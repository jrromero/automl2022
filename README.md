### Papers returned from queries to databases

From the list of papers returned by the search engines, a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to this list to obtain the list of primary studies. Then, variants of a primary study are identified for only reviewing the most complete manuscripts. Finally, a snow-balling procedure is conducted to retrieve any reference that could be disregarded during the literature search. The following spreadsheet compiles the available papers during each step of the literature search and selection strategy.
